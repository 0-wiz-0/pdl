** This is experimental code so use at your own risk! **

This directory contains various development efforts for
getting PDL to work with Padre starting with migrating
the existing perldl shell to use Devel::REPL which is
the basis of Padre::Plugin::REPL.

NiceSlice.pm

  Implements PDL::NiceSlice preprocessing for the Devel::REPL
  shell (i.e. Devel::REPL::Plugin::NiceSlice).  One way to
  get a basic shell going is as follows:

  # from bash prompt
  re.pl

  # from repl $ prompt
  do 'NiceSlice.pm';	# make Devel::REPL::Plugin::NiceSlice available
  $_REPL->load_plugin($_) for qw(NiceSlice CompletionDriver::Methods);
  do 'pdlrun';          # make PDL stuff available

  Now you have an interactive shell with history and method
  completion.  By default Devel::REPL always prints the result
  which differs from the perldl default.  This will be addressed
  in the official release but it is still usable.


pdlrun

  Startup stuff for PDL shell, loads modules and configuration.
