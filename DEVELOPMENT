This file has some information on how to get access
to the latest PDL sources (mainly of interest
for potential developers). This should not be confused
with the latest public release which will always
be available from CPAN (if you don't know what that
is check the FAQ).

Public CVS repository at www.sourceforge.org
--------------------------------------------

From version PDL-2.003 onwards the source distribution is
in a publicly accessible CVS repository. The project is
hosted at the sourceforge site at

	http://www.sourceforge.org/project/?form_grp=612

Starting from that URL you will find directions on how to check
out the current sources, browse the CVS repository online, etc.

If you would like to actively contribute to PDL development
don't hesitate to contact one of the project admins (listed
at the above URL) to apply for write access to the repository.
We strongly believe in the power of open source development!

If you do not know how to use CVS try 'man cvs' or 'info cvs'
and/or have a look at some of the online tutorials available
on the web. A nice concise one is at
