This file has some information on how to get access to the latest PDL
sources (mainly of interest for potential developers). This should not
be confused with the latest public release which will always be
available from CPAN (if you don't know what that is check the FAQ).

Public CVS repository at www.sourceforge.org
--------------------------------------------

From version PDL-2.003 onwards the source distribution is in a
publicly accessible CVS repository. The project is hosted at the
sourceforge site at

  http://www.sourceforge.org/project/?form_grp=612

Starting from that URL you will find directions on how to check out
the current sources, browse the CVS repository online, etc.

If you would like to actively contribute to PDL development don't
hesitate to contact one of the project admins (listed at the above
URL) to apply for write access to the repository. We strongly believe
in the power of open source development!

If you do not know how to use CVS try 'man cvs' or 'info cvs' and/or
have a look at some of the online tutorials available on the web. A
nice concise one is at

  http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-blandy-text.html

and a very good/complete ome is the online version of the CVS book at

  http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html


PDL Developer Guidelines:
-------------------------

The following guidelines are for any developer that has access to the
PDL CVS repository.

1) Before committing a change to the repository you should update:
    - CHANGES file with a description of the change made. 
    - MANIFEST (using 'make manifest'), MANIFEST.SKIP, TODO files if
      applicable.


2) Remember to include POD documentation for any functions you add to 
   the distribution. 
    - See Basic/Core/Core.pm for an example of including POD
      documentation in .pm files. 
    - See Basic/Core/Primitive/Primitive.pd for an example of 
      including POD documentation in PDL .pd files.
    - read the documentation in PDL::Doc for a detailed description of
      the PDL documentation conventions.

2) Make sure you add a test case in the 't' directory for any
   significant additional capability you add to the PDL package.

3) Don't commit before you successfully built and passed 'make
   test'. But then again, don't keep your changes private for too long
   to avoid conflicts with other developers.
 
4) Bugs reported on the list should be entered into the bug database
   and bugs closed when a patch has been committed as a fix. (Primary
   responsibility for this task is the pumpking, but other devels
   should be able to help.)
  
PDL Developer Notes:
--------------------

A (small) collection of random musings to note if you feel the need to
improve or add to PDL (please do):

*) Need help?

See the pdl-porters email list; details for subscription and access to
the archives can be found on the PDL web page at:

  http://pdl.perl.org/maillists/index_en.html
  http://pdl.perl.org/maillists/index_de.html
 
*) Access to PDL's configuration

If you need to access the configuration for PDL then use the
%PDL::Config variable. Prior to 2.4.1 this was a mess since you
had to use %PDL_CONFIG within Makefile.PL and PDL::Config from
*.pm/tests. The build process has been changed (I hesitate to say
"cleaned up" ;) to just use %PDL::Config.

- %PDL::Config is automatically available to you when you are in a
  Makefile.PL within the PDL distribution. You can change the hash
  and these changes will be stored in the PDL::Config module. You
  should only change values when it makes sense (e.g. if the user
  has specified that a module should be built but you find out this
  is not possible).
- otherwise you can say 'use PDL::Config;' or - perhaps something like
    eval 'require "' . whereami_any() . '/Core/Config.pm";';
  where whereami_any() is from PDL::Core::Dev;

*) Location of temporary files

Please use $PDL::Config{TEMPDIR} for the directory in which to
place temporary files (e.g. when IO::File::new_tmpfile() is not
appropriate). This will make it easier for distributions to package
PDL since there will only be one place they need to change if the
default value causes problems.

This *includes* test cases as well as for Makefile.PL's!


Creating a new CVS branch:
--------------------------

(or how to avoid ridiculous branch names like 
   'badval_experimental_branchpoint')

This is a first draft, so it may not entirely be correct, and I've
missed out the initial options you'd supply to cvs (or put in an env
variable).

0) see what the current set of tags is:

   > cvs status -v Changes 

   The important part of the output looks like:

   Existing Tags:
        badval_experimental_branchpoint (branch: 1.76.2)
        trid_experimental2              (branch: 1.69.2)
        trid_branchpoint2               (revision: 1.69)
     etc

   The badval_experimental branch wasn't created using the
   following rules - I didn't do step 1, so ended up
   with a branch name called 'badval_experimental_branchpoint'
   when I meant it to be 'badval_experimental'.

1) tag the current CVS with a label to indicate the state of
   PDL before the branch:

   > cvs tag make-cup-of-tea_experimental_branchpoint

   (this is the step I didn't do above)

2) create a branchpoint

   > cvs tag -b make_cup_of_tea_experimental

3) you can then either check out a new version, using this branch
 
   > cvs co -d PDL.tea -r make-cup-of-tea_experimental PDL

   this creates a directory PDL.tea/ and stores the files there,

   or convert a current version

   > cvs update -r make-cup-of-tea_experimental 

As I haven't yet closed a branch, I can't tell you how! The online CVS
documentation (eg http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html) is pretty
good.
