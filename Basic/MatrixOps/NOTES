Added a subset of the "Small Science Library" available from
geisshirt.dk, to handle eigens work.  The former 'eigens.c' is
now relegated to 'eigens_sym'.

This is intended to be a useful repository of self-contained linear
algebra routines.  Some of the stuff has been stolen from ../Math,
which in turn used the Cephes maths library sources.  Some of it was
ported to PDL from the algorithms in _Numerical_Recipes_, but the
original C code should probably be used if the copyrights allow it.
