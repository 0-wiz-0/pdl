A source filter for PDL: take the pain out of slicing !

Source filtering allows to experiment with new syntax
and the power is only limited by the sophistication of the
source parser.

Build the module in the usual way:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test  # no real test suite yet
  make install

Everything is still very experimental but the
principal approach seems promising.

The file 'local.perldc' contains some useful definitions to
experiment with the new syntax within the perldl shell.
