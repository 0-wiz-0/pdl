LUT.pm.PL contains the code, change this rather than LUT.pm or else your
changes will be over-written! 

The files in tables/*.lasc are used to create the colour tables.

The colour tables were taken from STARLINK's GAIA distribution, where they
have the GNU copyleft. Further information on STARLINK and GAIA can be found
via http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/ and http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~pdraper/.
