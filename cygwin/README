=================================================================
                            Overview
=================================================================
This directory contains supplemental build information to
configure and install PDL on a windows system with the cygwin
toolset (http://www.cygwin.com).

The cygwin library provides the missing unix/posix functionality
to allow unix applications to be more easily ported to windows.
A windows PC with cygwin looks like different flavor of unix.
Since cygwin looks like a unix, [almost] all of the standard
perl functionality works and PDL can build pretty much as it
does on other unix systems.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on building and
installing PDL on cygwin and for notes on building the external
dependencies.

See the PDL/win32 subdirectory for instructions on building a
native windows PDL.


=================================================================
                             WORKING
=================================================================
The cygwin PDL includes all the base PDL functionality          
including bad values support (if configured) as well as the     
following modules which depend on the presence of various       
external dependencies:                                          

 PDL::FFTW
  (Builds if FFTW version 2 has been built and installed)

 PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT
  (Builds if pgplot library has been built and installed)

 PDL::Graphics::PLplot
  (Builds if plplot library has been built and installed)

 PDL::Graphics::TriD
  (Builds automatically if you have X11 and OpenGL installed.
   It seems to work with native OpenGL as well as Mesa.)                 

 PDL::GSL::*
 PDL::GSLSF::*
  (Builds if GSL is installed)

 PDL::IO::GD
  (Builds if the gd lib is installed in cygwin)

 PDL::Slatec
  (Builds if ExtUtils::F77 has been installed)



=================================================================
                           NOT WORKING
=================================================================
These modules with external dependencies are not yet available
for cygwin:

 PDL::GIS::Proj         (PROJ4 builds/installs on cygwin but
                         the PDL build process does not complete)

 PDL::Graphics::IIS
  
 PDL::Graphics::Karma   (Karma has not been ported to cygwin)
  
 PDL::IO::Browser       (Build fails)

 PDL::IO::HDF           (HDF has not been ported to cygwin)
  
 PDL::IO::NDF           (Builds ok but needs cygwin port of NDF)

 PDL::Transform::Proj4  (PROJ4 builds/installs on cygwin but the
                         PDL build process does not complete)
