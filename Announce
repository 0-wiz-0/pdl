    Add support for USE_POGL => undef to perldl.conf
    Enable TriD builds when USE_POGL is enabled
    
    NOTE: unless WITH_3D is set to zero, it is possible that
    TriD will still be built with the legacy build structure
    even though it will not be using the Perl OpenGL module for
    the needed graphics bindings.

    Add POGL_VERSION option to perldl.conf
    Use POGL_VERSION in perdl.conf to use OpenGL
    Add $PDL::Config{POGL_VERSION} to the CPAN prereqs
    
      Now requires OpenGL-0.60 or greater.  If you need to
      build with a different version, edit perldl.conf
      appropriately.  Versions 0.59_00x should work for
      most platforms.
    
    Add POGL_WINDOW_TYPE parameter to perldl.conf
    POGL_WINDOW_TYPE now sets OpenGL window type
      to enable the use of PDL::Graphics::TriD::Tk
      in back compatibility mode.  Anyone using?

    Add GLUT init stuff to new for cleaner exits
    KNOWN_PROBLEMS (exit handler)

    Changed glutPrintString to glutBitmapString
    Added glutBitmapString support for GLUT-only installs
    ** TriD needs FreeGLUT or Apple GLUT! **

    Add PDL_INT check for t/opengl.t

    Add 3dtest.pl and line3d.pl as simple TriD graphics check programs

    Fix setting default TriD device to GL for all platforms
      (VRML broken for now)

    Fix legacy TriD build problems on cygwin

    Thanks to PC testing and feedback by Sisyphus
