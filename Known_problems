The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL:

- FFTW 3.0.1 is now out but is not supported (yet). You can use 2.x versions
  of FFTW, fall back on the built-in fft routines, or (best of all) submit a 
  patch. 

- Overly verbose but not particularly helpful text output from configure,
  built, test process.  This can be confusing for first time users.

- Compiler warnings from external code interfaces for several modules
  including for the following files: PLplot.xs, GD.xs, GD.c, INTERP.xs,
  RNG.xs, and RNG.c.

? Modern versions of MakeMaker (e.g. 6.22) fail to compile PDL, apparently
? because of the removal of the magic pm_to_blib target.  Current
? versions (such as 6.17, bundled with the current perl, v5.8.6) work OK. 
? With PDL 2.4.2, we have followed the core perl team in our use of
? earlier MakeMaker versions.

? If @INC has '.' at the front of the search path part of the build will
? fail (specifically mkpdlconv will not be able to 'use English' since
? it uses Exporter.pm from Basic/Core and not the system Exporter.pm).

?   [This appears to be fixed but this note is left FYI for the 2.4.2 release -- CED 16-Dec-2004 ]

? PDL::Graphics::TriD doesn't seem to link correctly on the Mac, under 
? MacOS 10.5 & 10.6.  It has not been fixed in part because TriD needs an 
? overhaul anyway, and in part because the code is cryptic.  If you'd like 
? to fix it, please do!  Patches welcome.  (PDL::Graphics::TriD is disabled
? by default on Mac installs, thanks, Doug)

? SourceForge bugs outstanding at time of release:
?
?   1530666  bugs in Transform.pm
?   1505171  failure in MatrixOps::eigens in CVS
?   1476324  How to force a completely clean installation
?   1465864  limits_round.t test failure
?   1465603  flexraw fails on Intel OS X with gfortran
?   1465414  Need lib64 version in various lib search paths for AMD64
?   1435189  Installation with cpan2rpm
?   1339530  pdlcore.c fails to build on IRIX and AIX
?   1205359  PGPLOT Window does not store full state info
