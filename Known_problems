The following issues have been reported with this version of
PDL:

- FFTW 3.0.1 is now out but is not supported (yet). You can use 2.x versions
  of FFTW, fall back on the built-in fft routines, or (best of all) submit a 
  patch. 

? PDL::GIS::Proj and PDL::Transform::Proj4 build fails on cygwin for
? clean install on system with no PDL already installed.  Currently
? the building of these PROJ4 modules is disabled for cygwin.  This
? problem may occur for other hardware/os combinations on a clean
? install.

? Modern versions of MakeMaker (e.g. 6.22) fail to compile PDL, apparently
? because of the removal of the magic pm_to_blib target.  Current
? versions (such as 6.17, bundled with the current perl, v5.8.6) work OK. 
? With PDL 2.4.2, we have followed the core perl team in our use of
? earlier MakeMaker versions.

? If @INC has '.' at the front of the search path part of the build will
? fail (specifically mkpdlconv will not be able to 'use English' since
? it uses Exporter.pm from Basic/Core and not the system Exporter.pm).
?   [added by Tim Jenness on 15 Apr 2000]
?   [This appears to be fixed but this note is left FYI for the 2.4.2 release -- CED 16-Dec-2004 ]

? PDL::Graphics::TriD doesn't seem to link correctly on the Mac, under 
? MacOS 10.5 & 10.6.  It has not been fixed in part because TriD needs an 
? overhaul anyway, and in part because the code is cryptic.  If you'd like 
? to fix it, please do!  Patches welcome.  (PDL::Graphics::TriD is disabled
? by default on Mac installs, thanks, Doug)

? The t/fits.t test and PDL::IO::FITS module can show problems when
? used with old versions of the Astro::FITS::Header module. If you have
? problems then please install the latest version from
?
?   http://search.cpan.org/~aallan/Astro-FITS-Header/
?
? (it is v2.8.1 at the time of writing) and see if this stops the problems.
? Note that Astro::FITS::Header has a somewhat esoteric numbering scheme
? (all the individual components have their own version number) which can
? make it hard to work out what version of  the package have installed.

? SourceForge bugs as follows:

?   1530666  bugs in Transform.pm
?   1505171  failure in MatrixOps::eigens in CVS
