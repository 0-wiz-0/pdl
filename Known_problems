The following issues have been reported with this version of PDL:


- Newly refactored PDL::Graphics::TriD now available on all
  platforms with FreeGLUT (or GLUT on Mac OS X).  X11+GLX is
  no longer required for 3D graphics.  By default, PDL will
  build with the new code enabled.  However, until the new
  implementation is completely stable, you will be able to
  turn off USE_POGL to get the original, legacy implementation.


- TriD graphics window contents are not refreshed when you resize
  the window.  However, a mouse click/motion or keyboard event will
  cause the refresh.


- NOTE: The default TriD controls are based on having at least
  a two button mouse.  While this is always the case for unix
  and windows, some mac systems apparently still have only one
  mouse button.  We need a strategy to compensate (SHIFT key?)


* IMPORTANT: Given the increased portability and generality of
  the new interface approach, it is expected that the legacy TriD
  build interface will be deprecated soon (almost immediately)
  and removed after that.  It has been unsupported for some time
  already.


- VRML output does not work for TriD.  If you have experience with
  interactive 3D graphics and would like to participate, please
  chime in on the perldl mailing list.


- FFTW 3.2.2 is the current release version of the FFTW library
  but is not yet supported by PDL::FFTW.  You may install version
  2.1.5 of FFTW which is supported, fall back to using the PDL's
  built-in fft routines (PDL::FFT), or submit a patch to update
  PDL::FFTW to the version 3 API. 


- Various make problems with build:

  - Using parallel make causes the build to fail so don't use -j # options.

  - Make fails with message like
      "*** No rule to make target `pptemplate', needed by `pptemplate.pod'.  Stop."
      If you have this error, please contact the PDL developers via the perldl
      mailing list and help us track this one down.  Thanks!


- Overly verbose but not particularly helpful text output from
  configure, built, test process.  This can be confusing for first
  time users.


- Lvalue subroutine errors have been reported for perl 5.6.2
  installation on a linux 2.4 kernel system.  Perl versions 5.8
  and above are *really* recommended.


- PDL::IO::Dumper has test failures on some systems that appear to result
  from an incorrectly detected/use flavor of uuencode or uudecode.  Work
  is underway to diagnose this further but if you install Convert::UU that
  should resolve the problem.  Patches welcome.


- PDL configuration failures have come about because needed temp files
  are not creatable.  This appears to be a result of platform misconfiguration
  but we need data points to understand the issue.


- 16bit image file IO fails in t/pic_16bit.t apparently due to an
  older version of NetPBM which does not support the raw 16bit formats.


- The following SourceForge bugs are outstanding at time of the 2.4.4_13
  point release:
