This is a ppm of PDL-2.1.1 to work with
activestate builds of perl 5.6.0. 

Version of PDL: PDL-2.1.1
built by: Tim Jennes <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu>
final packaging: Christian Soeller <c.soeller@auckland.ac.nz>

Installation:

  unzip the zip archive (using folder names)
  use the package manager to install PDL:

    ppm install --location=. PDL

PDL HTML Docs are installed into the activestate html tree. However,
due to a shortcoming of the current version of ppm, they are *not*
reflected in the activestate index of perl documentation. Please
point your browser by hand to the files in the html/lib/PDL directory.
The crossrefs in the html files are currently broken. The postinstall
script needs to fix this in the future.

PBMplus converters for gif, jpeg and postscript formats are
included (see PDL::IO::Pic).

Not yet supported on win32 are:

   Graphics (PGPLOT is in the works; watch this space)
   Slatec (on the TODO list)
   Memory mapped data access
   TriD OpenGL backend (VRML should be ok but requires Win32::DDE)

Further info:

  see PDL::FAQ and PDL::Impatient in the online
  documentation
